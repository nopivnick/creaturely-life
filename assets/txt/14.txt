An ancient creature has eluded the semblance here of a sanitized world, a semblance not solely on account of the airborne pathogens the air itself holds beneath the hemlock scent of antiseptic, but also microscopic pollen, human dander, spores, and the pungent musk of the doctor’s aftershave as he swirls in like a comet trailing his tail of young residents each of them perfumed as well with anxious youth, ambition, boredom, feigned empathy testosterone and estrogen, the whole pack of them vaguely fragrant with fatigue and rut, and not daring to meet her eyes lest they see their mother there. What they do not see is this spider, makings its way from the corner of the opposite wall farthest from the door, noiseless and patient, yes, and surely isolated as Whitman has it, he like you a Soundman born of Paumanok, familiar with this difficult labor of yours, the diminishing connection spun from breath alone “Till the bridge you will need, be form'd--till the ductile anchor hold” a lonely anthem for you both. But what of the creature itself, this spider, toiling there in the shadowy crease? Will it outlast you or rather join the nameless gulls fallen on the beach beyond, they like Whitman gone before you to the ageless place?
