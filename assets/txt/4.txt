She feels no affinity for the stray cat that patrols the postage stamp park below, its scraggly tail (her language is reduced to this: stray and scraggly, some discomfort, breathing comfortably, and the like) like a wire– or not that, a bottle washer, do they still make those?; its color soot, at least from this high up, although she would like to think it the color of rich velvet, she who has no sympathy for cats, their solitariness and sinuosity not hers, not hers to wind among the furniture, back curled up like a cartoon feline, she all her life moving erect, a word reserved she supposes for matrons or sexual organs, his having almost turned blue, hooded and shrunken as if preparing to greet its maker, its modest retreat surely not intended for the aide who treats it like meat when she baths him, the bright silver bowl of suds propped against his hip, her sponge unexpectedly the fairest shade of lavender and worn like a courtesan’s glove, her smile likewise, asking her “Would you rather do this for him or take this moment to step out?” What choices else, she does not ask this fair haired child, freckles on her cheek and upper breast when she bends over him. There was a time when he would not have missed this, taking advantage of every gap and vista upon the rich plenitude of women’s bodies. It is he who is like a cat, of course, prowling crevice and remove even in this sleep.
