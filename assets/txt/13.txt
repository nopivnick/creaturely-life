On the purloined tray the simulacra of a still life: veal piccata patty perched in a pool of lemon syrup and four small capers the size of BBs, a dab of dull ivory herbed rice, greens and a paper straw of balsamic dressing, 7- grain roll studded with seeds, Greek yoghurt and mixed berries, coffee hottle and (this is a surprise, the aide waits proudly for its discovery) an airline-sized bottle of non-alcoholic Chardonnay from Sonoma. “Isn’t that something! It’s from the gourmet carts. I thought you’d like the change.” It is something. She is like a plump sheep in her pink candy stripes, you want to hug her, draw her blond hair and blue eyes to your breast, whisper tales to her of nature morte.
