What evidences of living she could say if asked (but by whom?) having made such observance her new science: the faint sway, for instance, of the feathery hairs within his nostril like a Japanese landscape in miniature, thin reeds upon a cavern pool raked by a breeze perfumed with apple blossoms. It is the scent of opiates she supposes, still he works at this, his is the engine of these breezes, although mostly when awake his eyes are indistinct, not so much dull as deep, the blue of beach glass, rocked and polished in the underlying tides, the rip beneath that swells the crests farther out where the boys await on their boards, slick as seals, paddling listlessly. These eyes not the terrifying countenance of the cows (nor the angels) at Duino, “who do not, if one touches them, fall apart into a heap of words,” but who persist, this Rilke does not write exactly to the Princess Marie von Thurn und Taxis, they persist in mystery, they are themselves mystery, this is their being, the terror before which one sits and stares, looking for him there like a bauble lost in a tidal pool, a pretty ring or a holy medal (are there any longer such things?) pinned to the dress of a boy at baptism or to the bib of a hospital gown (surely it is a misprision to call them so, what ceremony or ball masque calls for this rude covering “fastened behind”?)– I’ve lost my place, she thinks, in this inventory of living (not living things, mind you, but living!); when– there!– as if on cue by way of further evidence he kicks free the bottom of a leg from the sheet where they persist in tucking him in, kicking free a life-long habit she can attest to who’s slept a hundred times a hundred nights next to him more or less, but to say now less, no more, seems to her maudlin, sleeping here in the chair counts she insists (to whom, she realizes now, is herself) and twice this week has crawled in and curled with him there, like twin commas interposed, yin and yang. Kicks free the other just then (it’s him, really, who is the measure of her insistence), wishing all his life to be born from whatever enclosures, do you see? She does, she sees the irregular black ankle bracelet now into which the dog bite has healed after years, in the form of a black crown, the beast gripping the ankle in its powerful jaw, teeth sunk to the bone, not fate or destiny but a dumb instance of chance, an indifferent hound, not attacking him exactly, but rather the figure in black moving along the sidewalk beyond the chainlink fence the hound had smashed against a hundred times before this one time the gate gave in where the mad woman had failed to latch it.
