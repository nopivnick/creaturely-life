Twice now she’s seen another discalced sister, the two of them not exactly barefoot yet exposed for all the world to see as prematurely grieving, virgins in this sense, vowed to silence, even to themselves, and thus they pass with a demure nod, eyes averted, each wearing sandals (that much orthodox) rather than the preferred flip flops of the other visitors, which is to say those with someone to talk to besides themselves, who come and go according to the posted hours more or less, and do not shower here a wall away from a disappearing man where there’s plenty to hold onto, sturdy grab bars fastened to each wall, a non-slip floor and shower seat, and a bright red emergency cord; but will it wake the dead? she wonders, laughing to herself, the little jokes of a Carmelite briefly inside her borrowed cell and for an instant truly naked, washed in innocence, compassing not thy altar but thy bed. And what if, she wonders (giddy now) the red cord popped a chute instead, shot one out among the angels and the doves like an ejection seat, she and this sister with her cup of tea, the string and tag hanging, soaring there, giggling and abandoning any attempt to keep their skirts from billowing like the hollyhock dolls she used to make with her real sisters so long ago that it seems it is her lifetime passing and not his within the box connected to this one by the wall she leans her head against.
