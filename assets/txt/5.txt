She imagines the boredom of hibernating animals bereft of dreams, if, that is, one believes animals to be unlike us. This is, she knows by benefit of television, a question current among philosophers who long ago spent time instead on the number and location of angels, whether the fabled dance of them on the head of a pin or the incorporeal mate that Maimonides imagined standing beside us each, each paired with a heavenly consort like twin cherries on a single stem, each visible fruit accompanied by its virtual other, a shadowless form, and so a question of physics not unlike the prior, where the dead go a variety of both, that is how many bodies can be stored in any one universe or heaven awaiting resurrection (perhaps they orbit deep space as some country preachers suggest). She longs for the slumber of the ground squirrel or the skunk, sealed off from winter and feeding on an adipose layer, dreamless beings; just to be able to sleep a single night again in something other than a reclining chair or upon the thin padding of hospital cot. Bears are another story, these days the authorities think them merely in torpor, prowling on occasion throughout the winter, eyes wide open when awake, but dreaming of what? Berries and taking a shit at winter’s end, not unlike this creature, her husband’s complaint the last time he prowled out from his torpor, complaining of constipation although he hadn’t eaten solids in weeks, another time longing, exactly, for berries, a bowl of blueberries, although he wasn’t known for loving them. Was it their spare perfection, the plumpness of their form, the faint sheen of condensation, blue puckered umbilicus?
