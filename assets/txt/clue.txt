Bottom; a clue or ball of thread.

One of the tricks of girls on Hallow-eve to find out the destined husband is to go out to the limekiln at night with a ball of yarn; throw in the ball still holding the thread; re-wind the thread, till it is suddenly stopped; call out ‘who howlds my bottom of yarn?’ when she expects to hear the name of the young man she is to marry.
