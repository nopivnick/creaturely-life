On occasions she ventures out to the little waiting room just down the corridor to where from time to time a small group waits for what they do not know as yet, a woman and her daughter, someone’s aging parents and spouse, they look up gratefully as if she is the bearer of some news. Yet what news she has she can’t say, she likes the silence here, thank god no television with its constant Fox, the tattered magazines months old, their mailing labels carefully excised lest you think of holding a doctor’s family hostage, or, perhaps more likely, coming there to sell Avon products or Girl Scout cookies. It is best when the room is empty and she can submerge herself in last December’s Flying, an old New Yorker, or Men’s Health Magazine with its monthly beefcake cover, slipping into a time whose future has already been put behind them and this present hour stays unforeseen. It is pleasant to reflect on how simple the unfolding seasons seem there still before one, what in retrospect was a succession of small rooms more or less like this not even, as they say, on the radar screen, instead clear skies and island-hopping, wry observations of an urban walker, or “Are You at risk for skin Cancer? 8 Warning Signs.” Once in a while someone will have left a current issue– largely glossy publications with single-word titles, Star or People or Time, although once someone left an LRB, the London Review of Books, the tabloid carefully folded over but also glossy, equally bewildering– the future in these pages meant to be hers and his. These left her confused unless she noticed the cover date before she began idly flipping through the pages, wondering was he calling for her or still drugged deep in dreams meant to kill all pain.
