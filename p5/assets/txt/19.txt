Down the hall where an old lady has lain alone for weeks, mouth open, a crown of grey hair braided atop her head, the bed is empty, made up tight as an unaddressed envelope. She feels a strange loss although they have never talked nor had she crossed the doorsill to see if someone sat there out of sight keeping witness in the way she sometimes does when she does not want to perform upon the stage of others’ inquisitiveness or sympathy. She will rise to her leading role soon enough, she knows, knows, too, the lines to which she will respond, though not yet what the script calls upon her to say. Better to disappear as did the former occupant of this tightly made bed, although that would be to confuse roles in this bedroom farce, going out, when one should be coming into some new part. Beldame rather than ingénue, Kore rising up from her bed of corn silks, crawling out of hell as every autumn, burdened with the weight of beginning again, looking in her mother’s rheumy eye, the old one’s worn weeds drabbed by summer sun, crows circling her tired body as the year ends or is begun, which does not matter to either of them.
