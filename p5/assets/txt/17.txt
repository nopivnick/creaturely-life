Have you seen any progress? a nurse asks her, not saying toward, or in relation to, what. She looks at the nurse’s face, surely this cannot be the kind of question posed to a centenarian woman in a documentary, say a one-time goat-herder, as she smokes a clay pipe on the threshold of a hut or sits in a rocking chair on the screened-in porch of the “assisted living” place to which she has retreated, the pipe neither filled nor lit, more like a bone whistle clutched between teeth of the same color as the soundless thing. Yet she knows what the nurse is asking. Here on the hospice floor there are such questions to be answered, if not in words, in actions. She wonders should she relay this query, bend toward him and whisper in his ear: are you getting nearer, darling? Instead she resolves to treat the question as benign or something more, a consolation, a woman-to-woman communication about the body and its functions, including this. “I like how his breathing varies,” she begins, “especially when it seems to ease and he relaxes, as if listening to Bach, as if making his own music,” as the woman nods.
