Wrens flit upon the sill as well, land and peck and set off again as if feeding upon miniscule seeds, invisible pollen, or perhaps dander, the world being a swirl of dander according to the science pages, dust to dust and such, they come and go these tiny things five floors up above the forlorn park, so clearly just an annex to the vast parking lots row on row of SUVs that stretch out like gravestones along the LIE. We have grown into acronymic times and trucks disguised as passenger cars, great dark things you cannot see around or through, and so process along the expressway as if mourners en route to a stranger’s funeral or to Orient Beach along the North Fork on a summer weekend. With some things it is better at the end, in winter, cocooned in a hooded, black parka, making your way among the terns at the dull edge of the dirty tidal froth, or closer in at Southhold along the saltwater wetlands of Arshamomque Pond.

Won’t you get up for just a little while and come with me, to the sea, the sea of love. I want to hold you, I want to tell you. Do you remember? Once you were my pet and now, I suppose, you are again. I watch you and think how lovely you are living just now, struggling against these hallucinatory dreams, waking a little disappointed not to have died, not to be free of all you have to do just now, all this business of sleeping and waking, landing and pecking and setting off.
