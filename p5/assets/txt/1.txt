It is how he lives that she watches she insists, for the dying will take care of itself, it has already become a thing for them, the dying, a disconsolate creature perched sometimes on the wide sill outside the window where yesterday a window washer swung from the canvas harness swiping interlaced crescents across the clouded glass as if a drab angel. But death, death takes the form of a monkey, the Mandrillus sphinx, the blue ridges of its muzzle fierce as a Maori tattoo below amber eyes, sitting propped on its magnificently multi-colored rump, the colors of cotton candy, sucking the flesh from a peach that someone has left on a tray, such a bounty gone to waste hereabouts, the dying having no appetite for such a damp, sweet lusciousness as a random peach. Watching him she longs for dampness once again, just one more what? One more anything, the feeling as he descends over her smooth belly to the place between her thighs, or the simple kiss of early lovers, before the mouth becomes perfunctory, dry, its crater swabbed with foam tipped swabs, which the bright young thing, the one who brings a smile to him, said “you can suck on like a lollipop.” It was hard not to hate her for her youth or begrudge an innocence that cannot suspect a graying (for she is still more raven than owl) woman of bawdy, let alone lasciviousness, that fucking monkey, death, let’s call it by its name, eating the conventional banana like a bewildered frau on an amateur porn site, wondering how has our marriage come to this? three minute segments of fellatio, pushing the hair back from your eyes awaiting the crowning moment, the fucking mandrill, sphinx, laughing in raucous cheeps his dreadful yellow teeth exposed between the nostrils and lips red as if it had just fed upon a plum or the still bloody corpse of a young antelope. And now she wants to know would you like to eat anything, this girl, “I can bring you a tray if you want to stay.” Yes, I want to eat you up, to suck the life from you until you moan not knowing whether you are coming or going, so to speak, feeding the sweet mush back to him, forcing my tongue between the dry lips like a swab, filling him like a mother bird her fledgling.
