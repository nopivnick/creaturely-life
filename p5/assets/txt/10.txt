She resolves that she will not examine the phrase “nothing’s happening,” partly because every moment is filled with microscopic event, a twitch here or there (no need to categorize it), the eye tracking something under the lid (she is sorry for her imprecision), moving side to side slowly beneath it in the way a hunter tracks a solitary merganser across the surface of the bay at twilight, the dog not stirring, knowing there is no shot, not any dog but the Nova Scotia Toller who rode out proudly in the Barnegat Bay Sneakbox red gold against the red gold light at dusk or sunrise, “the smartest dog there ever was” or so he said after it was gone, named Oisín after the son of Fionn mac Cumhaill, he died of old age, the dog not Finn, since the story is that the latter sleeps down in his cave beneath Áth Cliath, the black pool, waiting to rise again. All this, of course, has been written of as well as the subject of sentimental barroom songs. It is a wonder that she knows this genealogy, for she never much cared for songs or the hunt or– though she is one, and not just by marriage– the Irish. God knows, though, she loved the tribal in him… Here she stops herself, for it is important to avoid any past tense, even the historical present, this being the second flaw adhering to the phrase, for to say that nothing’s happening is to give the void its due as thing rather than event, to pretend some occurrence is the end, for instance when the night descends upon the stout grass in the shallows, birds no longer stirring, bats swooping low to snatch mosquitoes, Oisin whimpering asleep inside the sneakbox, dark tide lapping as the boat glides gently home under sail.
