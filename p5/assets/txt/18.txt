Was it in India where a widow would lie down on the funeral pyre beside her husband like figures tipped over on a wedding cake or how one surrenders in a game of chess? To sleep… the line is Hamlet’s not Ophelia’s, who lay down upon the garlanded waters in the painting of Millais she loved as a schoolgirl, flowers flowing from her hand against the stream, not looking dead in the least, and not yet dead in fact, a hand lifted, lipsticked lips apart, the eyes part open, or so she remembered the image, gilt bosom and skirt flowered likewise, honeysuckle leaning over the stream from the opposite bank. The benefits of a sentimental education serve her well here, she has overheard others commenting upon her smile in the corridor outside the room, how she never seems tired, not knowing yet the bone-deep weariness that comes to her who floats upon this stream, a weariness that feigns, or begs, surcease, that bloats the limbs and makes them buoyant.
